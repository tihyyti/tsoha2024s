"""
Let’s convert the Spring Boot-based @Service part into a Flask application using the improved database model. We’ll create Python classes and corresponding routes (endpoints) for each service. Below, I’ll provide an example of how you can structure your Flask application:

We’ve created an AuthenticationService class with an authenticate method.
The /authenticate route accepts a POST request with JSON data containing username and password.
It calls the authenticate method to validate the credentials.
If authentication succeeds, it returns {'authenticated': True}; otherwise, it returns an error
message.
Remember to adapt this example to your specific use case, add more service classes, and define
additional routes as needed. You can also integrate Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML/CSS-based
UI if required

Create a Flask Application:
Set up your Flask application by creating a Python file (e.g., app.py).
Initialize the Flask app and configure SQLAlchemy to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
Define Service Classes:
Create Python classes that correspond to your Spring @Service classes.
Implement the business logic for each service.
Routes (Endpoints):
Define Flask routes (endpoints) that handle HTTP requests.
Map these routes to the appropriate service methods.
Here’s an example of how you can structure your Flask application:
"""

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/yourdatabase'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Define your service classes (similar to Spring @Service)

class AuthenticationService:
    def authenticate(self, username, password):
        # Your authentication logic here (e.g., check credentials in the database)
        # Return True if authenticated, else False
        pass

# Create routes (endpoints) for your services

@app.route('/authenticate', methods=['POST'])
def authenticate_user():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        username = data['username']
        password = data['password']

        auth_service = AuthenticationService()
        authenticated = auth_service.authenticate(username, password)

        return jsonify({'authenticated': authenticated})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
